# The Weather Application

- Repository: `weather-app` 🌞
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
- Duration: `5 days` 🕓
- Deadline : `29/11/2022` 🔔
- Deployment strategy: `Github page` or `Netlify`
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Mission objectives

In this challenge you will use and consolidate your knowledge on:

- A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
- Dynamic components
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an api

## The Mission

You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.  
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.

### Specifications

#### 🌱 Must-have features

- In the home page the user can enter the city of his/her choice (think of the right HTML elements here)
- On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days
- Use the API of https://unsplash.com/ to show a photo of the city they entered in the form
- The application must be responsive and mobile friendly

> 💡 Not sure where to start? Split this features into multiple smaller todos (in your code, sketch, ...)

#### 🌼 Nice-to-have features (in no specific order)

- Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org)
- Remember the user choice on subsequent visits
- Allow the user to compare the weather in two cities

### Instructions

- Create an account on [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/.), and generate a key
- Get the weather data.

#### Code Quality

Even if you're working alone on this project, we need you to enforce your _code quality_.

You will use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format your code, and [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to ensure your code following _good practices_.

You will use the [BeCode Presets](https://github.com/becodeorg/eslint-config). When your project's package.json file is created, execute the following command: `npx @becode/eslint-config --with-hook`.

It will install Prettier & ESLint and a _git hook_ to run it before your commits.

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** if there's an ESLint error in your code, your commit will not be allowed. Correct the error and retry!

> 🧨 **WARNING:** disable ESLint **is not** an option!

## _“When the ass begins to bray, surely rain will come that day.”_ (Good luck!)
